BT1101 - Week 7 - 13 Predictive Analytics

Apart from the course materials shared here on Canvas, this is a collection of Rmd notebookds for my lecture topics. 
In the semesters, I've made the Rmd notebooks available for download also on Canvas on a weekly basis. However, I've spent some time 
scaffolding the concepts through these notebooks and decided to put them on GithubLinks to an external site.This means you can access all the notebooks from Day 1, which might come in handy for this module.

I hope that these notebooks will help your understanding to do even better in the course.
